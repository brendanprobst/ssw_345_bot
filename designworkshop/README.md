a.What is the core problem each bot is trying to solve?

FocusBot: large teams struggle to communicate and thus haven a hard time being productive, staying on strack, and meeting deadlines.
Individuals struggle to keep track of all their tasks
AiBot: people struggle to write in a professional manner and need an easier way to communicate

b.Why is it a problem worth solving?
FocusBot: Missing deadlines is one of the main reasons that students' grades suffer or teams miss their deadlines and this bot strives to eliminate those missed assignments by giving constant reminders and/or allocating the work to different group members.
AiBot: This is a very common problem and extends to emails, professional profiles and websites, written speeches and presentations, and more. This bot would save the writer the hassle of formalizing their language so they can focus on the content. 3. Describe possible designs: (10 minutes).
